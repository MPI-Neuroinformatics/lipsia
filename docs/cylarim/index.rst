Laminar-specific fMRI (Cylarim)
======================================


Cylarim is an innovative software package for laminar fMRI analysis that
addresses a major limitation of many existing approaches: their reliance on pre-defined regions of interest (ROIs).
The definition of ROIs often involves arbitrary choices,
making them difficult to justify and prone to bias.
To overcome this problem, Cylarim utilizes small, overlapping cylinders that traverse the cortical ribbon,
enabling a comprehensive mapping of laminar-specific activity across extensive cortical regions.
